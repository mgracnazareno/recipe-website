        <h1>Salisbury Steak with Mushrooms</h1>

        <p>A great from scratch salisbury steak and gravy recipe. The mushroom and onion 
            gravy is wonderful over mashed potatoes or rice. The gravy is still good 
            without mushrooms. I've made it for my husband that way.
        </p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>1 lb lean ground beef</li>
            <li>⅓ cup dry bread crumbs</li>
            <li>¼ cup chopped onions</li>
            <li>1 egg, beaten</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>¼ teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>2 cups beef broth</li>
            <li>1 large onion, thinly sliced
            </li>
            <li>1 cup sliced mushrooms</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons cornstarch</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons water</li>
        </ul>

            <li>
                <p>Combine ground beef, bread crumbs, chopped onion, egg, salt, and black pepper in a bowl until evenly mixed. Shape beef mixture into 4 patties, about 3/4 inch thick.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Fry patties in a large skillet over medium heat until browned on both sides, about 10 minutes. Add beef broth, onion, and mushrooms; bring to a boil.
